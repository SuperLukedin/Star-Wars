This web app was written in Vue.js, JavaScript and CSS3. When the page is initially loaded, it sends GET request to https://swapi.co/api/people/ to fetch people data. The response are stored into vuex, a centralized state management of vue, and then displayed on the <template> of the web page.<br><br>
There is a list of buttons of people's name, click them you will see the original object data.<br><br>
Please also use "Search" bar to do the fuzzy match and filter the list.<br><br>

That's it! Hope you have a wonderful day! :) <br><br>
